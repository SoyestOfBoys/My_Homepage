            <h1>Gen Con 2022</h1>
            <p>Gen Con 2022 was a unique one because we did not have a major release at the convention to build our marketing around. The only new product we had to sell was the <a href='https://czechgames.com/en/galaxy-trucker-keep-on-trucking/' rel='noreferrer'> Galaxy Trucker: Keep on Trucking expansion</ a>. However, due to one of the other co-sponsors dropping out, this year we were one of only two major sponsors of the show, leading to us having a bigger exhibit room and more locations available to us for advertising.</p>
            <p>As we didn't have a big release, I made the call to focus our convention on increasing our name recognition. Many people know games like Codenames, Lost Ruins of Arnak, and Galaxy Trucker; but not nearly as many knew that CGE were the people behind many of their favorite games.</p>
            <p>My first step for this was securing a new advertising location for us with 3 large banners right by the main entrance and behind the very popular "Cardhalla" atraction:</p>
            <div className="GC2pic">

                </div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>These banners featured 3 of CGE's most popular titles help build the connection between them in people's mind and increase brand awareness of CGE. </p>
            <p>Gen Con also makes use of the field of Lucas Oil Stadium. I worked with Gen Con to open up the Jumbo-Tron for exhibitors to use for advertising:</p>
            <div className="GC1pic">
                <img src={gen22cov} alt='The Jumbotron at the Luc' />
            </ div>
            <p>The final new initiative we ran was a scanvenger hunt, were attendees could find clues hidden around the convention to help them solve puzzels in a web app with the chance to win games once completed. At registration every attendee receives a bag to put games and swag in, and we used these to advertise the hunt:</p>

            </div>
            <p>We also focused on our two upcoming big-box releases "Starship Captains" and "Deal With the Devil". I trained our demo staff to run previews for both titles which recieved a warm reception at the show, including Deal With the Devil winning the Gaming Trend 'Best of Show' award. </p>
            <div className="GC2pic">

                </ div>
            </ div>
            <p>Along side these efforts we featured an improved Giant Galaxy Trucker to promote the expansion, as well as improvements to Giant Pictomania to further my Giant Games project I introduced the prior year</p>

            </div>
            <p>We also ran site book and coupon book adds, ran an extensive demo room, and had other advertising around the show. You can see more highlights in the slideshow below:</p>

                                <p>In 2021 we brought on 2 full time content creators to help expand our reach in the Board Game media space. To accomodate this I created a media space inside our exhibit room, which was very well recived.</p>

                            <p>Here's another look at Giant Galaxy Trucker. The giant games initiative is among my favorite projects I spearheaded at CGE. They are great show-stoppers that bring large crowds, and served to increase intrest in product from both those playing the giant versions and the people watching. </p>

                            <p>Every year we put out a new collectable pin for Gen Con. These pins have three benefits: they are a high profit item when sold on it's own, they offer a compelling promotional item that we gave free with high dollar purcheses, and they bring in pin collectors who may not normally be interested in our games. This is the final design document. I designed this pin based on existing artwork for Galaxy Trucker: Keep on Trucking, which was then polished to meet needed specs by our partner at Foam Brain. </p>
